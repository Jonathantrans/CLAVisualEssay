          I will start off saying that this photo series will demonstrate my progression in fighting to find myself, building myself, and building a family I can protect as my goals in life. I did extensive research outside the book on these individuals, utilizing outside sources cited in my Works Cited down below.</p><p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1700" data-aos-delay="500">The first photograph I have will start with my childhood days.          </p>

          In this second photo, I started to appreciate how my dad was there for me, taking good care of my sister and I. I can make the comparison that he was fighting to protect us by constantly working and making a ton of sacrifices such as selling his family treasures to put food on the table.

        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1700" data-aos-delay="500">
        Spartacus, a historical figure from the history of Rome, also was fighting to protect the one's he cared about. My dad was a slave to the system and Spartacus was enslaved by the Romans, "A Thracian by birth, Spartacus served in the Roman army, perhaps deserted, led bandit raids, and was caught and sold as a slave" (Britannica 1).</p>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1700" data-aos-delay="500">
          My dad's goals of protecting his kids led to his death, which closely parallels to Spartacus, dying to fight for the freedom he always wanted for the people who also fell victim to the Romans, "Spartacus, (died 71 BCE), leader in the Gladiatorial War (73–71 BCE) against Rome" (Britannica 1). Little did I know, I would fall victim to the system that makes financial freedom difficult.

          After my father's passing, I grieved but I knew that the people I needed to take care of was my family and myself. There was a lot of pressure, but I wanted to work hard and fight for the people I love, just like Spartacus. His goal of fighting to protect others, as well as himself, closely align to mine. His mindset is what made him become the leader in the Third Servile War, "The Third Servile War is the most famous one; it happened in 
mainland Italy and was led by the enslaved gladiator Spartacus" (CLA 3 Week 3 Day 2, Slavery.pptx). </p>

          As I started highschool, I soon began to realize I was a couple years from going to college and working. I needed to support my mother and sister by working sooner or later. I needed some type of hope that would allow me to succeed. Although Victoria, a mythical Roman god, did not have any goals, she was an important symbol of hope and victory which I wanted to become, "the Roman goddess of victory, was connected with the victors of war, who she was believed to be able to determine. She was a favorite amongst Roman generals returning from war" (talesbeyondbelief 1).

          My goals of becoming stronger mentally and physically to take care of my family grew stronger. I needed to become someone my mom and sister can rely on. I want to achieve the body I always wanted, the family I always wanted, and care for the current family I have. As I stated before, I want to be someone similar to Spartacus, fighting for the people he loves, as well as his own freedom. I am fighting for financial freedom. At this point of my life, I got into bodybuilding and worked 50 hours shifts.</p>

          I took this photo 2 months ago. I was dreaming for better days and working hard on my goals of attaining a stronger body and mind. I always thought of myself to becoming something similar to that of the moon. The moon glows bright on the darkest days, and that sense of hope made me push through. After learning more about Roman history, Spartacus goals of fighting for his freedom from the Romans and becoming a symbol of hope that shines bright on the battlefield is what made him the awe-inspiring leader he was, discussed previously. Victoria also stands as a symbol of victory and hope and closely symbolizes the moon, discussed previously of how commanders would come back to her symbol in victory.

          This photo I took on the same week I was in San Francisco meant a lot to me. Again, it was hard to spread my wings like a bird and live comfortably. I was chained to our labor system, working 50 hours a week, and was constantly working out to build muscle. I was exhausted. My life and goals closely paralleled to Spartacus as he was, too, working hard and relating to his constant exhaustion in the war, as well as being trapped in labor, "In many ways, slavery in the ancient world and slavery as we know about it from the modern world were similar:
Enslaved people were often forced to work brutal hours at physically gruelling jobs, especially in agriculture" (CLA 3 Week 3 Day 2, Slavery.pptx).        </p>

          Another picture I took on my camera at San Francisco. As both the sun and moon puts light in the sky, as I said before, I want to be a symbol of hope and victory just like Victoria. Victoria is the sun that everyone wants to wake up to, "Victoria installed in the senate building, the Curia Julia, with a statue of the winged Victoria, called a victoriola, symbolically standing with one foot on a globe. A victoriola was given to a victorious general and symbolized a gift of victory and was highly prized for the renown it bestowed on its owner" (talesbeyondbelief 1).

           Just like trees and plants, they grow very well as long as they are well taken care of. This image has a lot of meaning because in a way, Spartacus and I are both hardworking individuals, and overtime, we are growing to become the man people can look up to. This also connects with Victoria as she is the symbol of victory; she too is a fully grown tree that embodies that goal of ours.</p>

         I recently adopted a kitten and it truly reminds me of how far I have reached my goals, yet so close but far. As a recap, my goals consist of fighting to find myself, building myself, and building a family I can protect. My goals closely resemble that of Sparatacus; his desire to be unchained from the slavery system Rome once had and fighting for himself, as well for the people he loves and cares about. We both are aiming to be that symbol of hope and victory, just as Victoria was. These two individuals of Rome really embody who I am trying to become. I do not see any differences between us.
